A minimalist, real-time cryptocurrency price tracker built natively for **Wear OS** using **Jetpack Compose**. Displays live prices for 8 coins directly on your wrist, with 24h change indicators, haptic alerts, and a USD/CAD currency toggle.

This app intentionally tracks a curated selection of **ISO 20022 compliant cryptocurrencies** — digital assets aligned with the global financial messaging standard being adopted by SWIFT, central banks, and major financial institutions worldwide.

## ISO 20022 Compliant Coin Tracker

ISO 20022 is the international standard for financial messaging used in payments, securities, and trade finance. Several of the coins tracked in this app have been identified as ISO 20022 compliant or compatible, meaning they are built to integrate with the modern global financial system.

| Coin | Symbol | ISO 20022 Status |
|---|---|---|
| Quant | QNT | Compliant — interoperability layer for financial networks |
| XRP | XRP | Compliant — adopted for cross-border payments via RippleNet |
| Stellar | XLM | Compliant — designed for global remittance and payments |
| Cardano | ADA | Compliant — smart contract platform aligned with standards |
| Algorand | ALGO | Compliant — used by financial institutions and central banks |
| Hedera | HBAR | Compliant — enterprise-grade distributed ledger |
| IOTA | IOTA | Compliant — machine economy and IoT financial transactions |
| XDC Network | XDC | Compliant — trade finance and cross-border settlement |

These coins represent the intersection of **blockchain technology and traditional financial infrastructure** — a space increasingly relevant to cybersecurity professionals working in fintech, banking, and critical infrastructure protection.

- **Language:** Kotlin 100%
- **UI:** Jetpack Compose for Wear OS
- **Architecture:** MVVM (ViewModel + StateFlow)
- **Networking:** Retrofit 2 + OkHttp + Gson
- **Async:** Kotlin Coroutines
- **API:** [CoinGecko Free API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api)

## Security & Privacy

- No API keys stored — uses CoinGecko's public free-tier endpoint
- No user data collected — fully local, no accounts or tracking
- No sensitive permissions — only `INTERNET`, `VIBRATE`, `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE`
- Read-only API calls — no write operations or authentication required
- All network calls made over HTTPS

This project demonstrates an understanding of minimal permission principles, secure API consumption, and data privacy by design — core concepts in application security.

## About This Project

This project was built to demonstrate practical Android and Wear OS development skills including:

- Native Wear OS UI with Jetpack Compose and `ScalingLazyColumn`
- MVVM architecture with clean separation of concerns
- REST API integration with Retrofit and coroutines
- State management with `StateFlow` and `collectAsState`
- Haptic feedback using `VibrationEffect` across API levels
- Real-world error handling — graceful degradation on network failure
